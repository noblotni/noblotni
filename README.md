# Hey there 👋 I'm Nicolas

I'm a curious mind exploring the intersection of **science**, **technology**, and **creativity**.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 Lifelong learner with deep interests in:
  - 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
  - 🎶 Music (especially when it meets math & code). Thus I am a piano player.
  - 🧲 Physics & the Universe
  - 📐 Mathematics (yes, I *do* think math is beautiful)
  - 💻 Computer Science & problem solving

- 🌌 I believe science is not just a subject — it's a *lens* through which I see the world.
- As Einstein said: 
    "Life is like a bicycle. You have to keep moving forward to maintain your balance. And knowledge is the drive."
- 🛠 Currently learning more about neural networks, generative AI, and the math that powers them.

## 🎼 When I'm Not Coding...

- You might find me experimenting with **AI-generated music**, playing the piano, reading about **quantum physics** or lost in thought over an elegant math proof.
- I'm fascinated by how **logic and creativity** come together to build the future.
